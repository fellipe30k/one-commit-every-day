Here's an example of a README.md file that explains how to write a simple read CSV in Python:

# Reading Simple CSV Files in Python

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to read simple CSV files using the `pandas` library in Python.

## Installation

To use this code, you'll need to install the following libraries:

* `pandas`: You can install it using pip: `pip install pandas`

## Usage

1. Save this file as `read_csv.py`
2. Run the script using Python: `python read_csv.py < csv_file_name.csv` (replace `< csv_file_name.csv>` with the name of your CSV file)
3. The script will print out the contents of the CSV file to the console.

## Tips and Variations

* If you have a large CSV file, consider using `pandas.read_csv()` instead of manually reading the file line by line.
* You can customize the script to handle errors or exceptions more robustly by adding try/except blocks.
* For larger datasets, you may want to consider using a more efficient data structure like a database or a specialized library for CSV processing.

## Limitations

This script assumes that your CSV file has a simple format with no headers. If your file has complex columns or header rows, the script will need to be modified accordingly.
