# Simple Read CSV in Python
==========================

A quick guide on how to read a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file using Python.

## Requirements
---------------

* Python 3.x

## Usage
-----

### Reading a Single Row

```bash
python csv_reader.py input.csv
```

This will print the contents of the specified row from your CSV file.

### Reading Multiple Rows

```bash
python csv_reader.py input.csv
```

This will print all rows from your CSV file, one per line.

## Options
-------

You can customize the behavior by passing options to the `csv_reader.py` script. Here are a few examples:

* `-n` (number of columns): Specify the number of columns you want to read.
```bash
python csv_reader.py input.csv -n 2
```

* `-v` (verbose output): Print out more information about each row and column.

## Code
-----

### `csv_reader.py`
```python
import csv

def main():
    # Specify the file path and delimiter
    filename = "input.csv"
    delimiter = ","

    # Check if the file exists
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            reader = csv.reader(file)
            for row in reader:
                print(row)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The file '{filename}' does not exist.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Troubleshooting
------------------

* If you encounter issues with your CSV file, make sure it's properly formatted (no quotes around values, etc.).
* Check the file path and filename to ensure they are correct.
