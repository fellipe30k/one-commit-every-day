You're referring to the classic "Hello World" program. Here's an example of how you can create it in Python:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

This code simply prints out "Hello, World!" to the console when executed.

If you want to run this as a standalone program (i.e., without being called from another script), you'll need to add some extra steps. Here's an example of how to do it using the `main()` function:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello_world()
```

In this code, we define a function called `hello_world` that simply prints out "Hello, World!". The `if __name__ == "__main__":` part ensures that the `hello_world()` function is only executed when the script is run directly (i.e., not when it's imported as a module by another script).
