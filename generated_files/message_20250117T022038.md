Here's an example of a README.md file that explains how to write a simple read CSV in Python:

# Read CSV File in Python

A simple guide on reading a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file in Python.

* [Example Use Case](#example-use-case)

## Getting Started

This guide assumes you have Python installed on your computer. If you don't have it, you can download and install it from the official Python website: <https://www.python.org/downloads/>

## Reading the CSV File

To read a CSV file in Python, you'll need to use the `csv` module.

### Importing the Module
```python
import csv
```
This imports the entire `csv` module, which provides functions for reading and writing CSV files.

### Creating an Readable CSV File
```python
# Create a new CSV file called "example.csv"
with open("example.csv", "w") as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    writer.writerow(["Name","Age"])
```
This creates a new CSV file named `example.csv` in the same directory. The `writerow()` function adds two rows to the file, with `"Name"` and `"Age"` columns.

### Reading the CSV File

To read the entire CSV file into memory, you can use the `read()` method:
```python
with open("example.csv", "r") as csvfile:
    reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
    data = list(reader)
```
This reads the entire CSV file and stores it in the `data` variable.

## Example Use Case

Here's an example of how you can use this code to parse a CSV file:
```python
import csv

# Create a new CSV file called "example.csv"
with open("example.csv", "w") as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    writer.writerow(["Name","Age"])

# Read the CSV file and print the data
with open("example.csv", "r") as csvfile:
    reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)

```
This example creates a new CSV file, reads it, and then prints each row of data.

## Conclusion

Writing a simple read CSV in Python is a straightforward process that requires importing the `csv` module and creating or reading an existing CSV file. This guide provides a step-by-step example of how to do this.
