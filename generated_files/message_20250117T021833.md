Here's an example of a basic README.md file that explains how to write a simple read CSV in Python:

# Writing a Simple CSV File in Python
=====================================================

This guide shows you how to create and read a simple comma-separated values (CSV) file in Python.

## Prerequisites
---------------

* Python 3.6+
* A text editor or IDE of your choice

## Step-by-Step Instructions
---------------------------

### Creating the CSV File

1. Open a text editor or IDE, such as Notepad++ or PyCharm.
2. Create a new file with a `.csv` extension (e.g., `example.csv`).
3. Write the data into the file, one row per line and separated by commas.

Example:
```
Name,Age,Country
John Doe,30,USA
Jane Smith,25,UK
```

### Reading the CSV File

1. Import the `csv` module from Python's standard library.
2. Use the `read_csv()` function to read the CSV file into a list of dictionaries.

Example:
```python
import csv

def read_csv(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            reader = csv.DictReader(file)
            data = [row for row in reader]
            return data
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"File not found: {file_path}")
        return None
    except csv.Error as e:
        print(f"Error reading CSV: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage:
data = read_csv('example.csv')
print(data)
```

## Tips and Variations
----------------------

* Use the `csv.DictReader()` function to read dictionaries instead of raw rows.
* Add error handling for file I/O errors, such as missing or corrupt files.
* Use this example as a starting point to work with more complex CSV files.

By following these steps and tips, you should be able to create and read simple CSV files in Python using the `csv` module.
