Here's an example of what your README.md file could look like:

# Reading Simple CSV Files with Python

## Introduction

This guide explains how to read simple CSV (Comma Separated Values) files using Python. We will cover the basic concepts and techniques required to parse and analyze CSV data.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* `csv` module (included in the Python standard library)

## Installation

To use this example, simply install the required package by running `pip install pyreadcsv`. If you are using a Jupyter Notebook or other interactive environment, you can also install it directly from within the notebook.

## Reading CSV Files

### Basic Example
```python
import csv

def read_csv(file_path):
    """Reads a simple CSV file and returns its contents as a list of lists."""
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as csvfile:
            reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
            data = list(reader)
        return data
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"File not found: {file_path}")
        return []

# Example usage
csv_data = read_csv('example.csv')
print(csv_data)
```

### Handling Missing Values

You can handle missing values in the CSV file by using the `csv.reader` object's built-in support for handling `NaN` (Not a Number) values.
```python
import csv

def read_csv(file_path):
    """Reads a simple CSV file and returns its contents as a list of lists."""
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as csvfile:
            reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
            data = []
            for row in reader:
                # Check for missing values
                if not all(row):
                    # Handle missing values (e.g., fill with NaN or ignore)
                    pass
                data.append(list(row))
        return data
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"File not found: {file_path}")
        return []

# Example usage
csv_data = read_csv('example.csv')
print(csv_data)
```

## Advanced Topics

* Handling quoted strings and escaped characters
* Parsing complex CSV formats (e.g., `tab-separated` files)

### Resources

For more information on CSV parsing in Python, see the official [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) or online resources such as:
* [csv module documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html)
* [W3Schools' CSV tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/csv/)
* [Stack Overflow's CSV question queue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/csv)

This is just a basic example to get you started. You can always add more features and functionality as needed for your specific use case.
