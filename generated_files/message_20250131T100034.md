Here's an example of what your README.md file might look like:

# Simple CSV Writer in Python
==============================

This is a simple script that writes data from the console to a CSV file.

## Installation
---------------

To run this script, save it as `csv_writer.py` and install the required libraries with pip:
```bash
pip install csv
```

## Usage
-----

### Running the Script
```bash
python csv_writer.py <data>
```
Replace `<data>` with a string of comma-separated values, where each value is on its own line.

Example:
```bash
$ python csv_writer.py "Name,Age,Country" 25,USA,UK
```

## Explanation
--------------

This script uses the `csv` module to write data from the console to a CSV file. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The script prompts the user for input using `input`.
2. The user is prompted to enter multiple values separated by commas.
3. Each value is parsed as a string and stored in an empty list (`data` variable).
4. The script iterates over each value, converting it to a float if necessary (e.g., "25" becomes 25.0).
5. The script writes each value to the CSV file with the header row specified by `input`.
6. If no input is provided, the script returns without writing anything.

## Notes
-------

* This script assumes that the user will enter data in a simple format (e.g., just numbers separated by commas).
* Error handling is minimal; if the user enters invalid data (e.g., multiple values on one line), the script may fail or produce unexpected results.
