# Simple Hello World in Python
==========================

This is a basic guide on how to write a simple "Hello, World!" program in Python.

## Prerequisites
---------------

* A text editor or IDE of your choice (e.g. PyCharm, VS Code)
* Python installed on your system (preferably the latest version)

## Step-by-Step Instructions
---------------------------

1. Open your text editor or IDE and create a new file.
2. Type `print("Hello, World!")` into the file.
3. Save the file with a `.py` extension (e.g. `hello_world.py`).
4. Run the file using Python by navigating to the directory containing the file in your terminal/command prompt, typing `python hello_world.py`, and pressing Enter.

## Running the Program
--------------------

When you run the program, you should see the following output:
```
Hello, World!
```

## Notes
------

* This is a simple example of how to write a Python script.
* You can modify this code to create more complex programs by adding additional variables and logic.
* If you're new to programming, it's recommended to start with basic tutorials before attempting to write a full application.
