# Writing Hello World in Python
=====================================

This is a basic guide on how to create a "Hello, World!" program in Python.

## Prerequisites

* Basic knowledge of Python programming
* A text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) of your choice

## Step 1: Write Your First Program

Create a new file with a `.py` extension and add the following code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

This is a simple "hello world" program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

## Step 2: Run Your Program

Save the file (e.g. `hello_world.py`) and run it using your preferred method (e.g. terminal, command prompt, IDE). The output should be:

```
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations! You have just written and run your first Python program.

## Best Practices

* Always use a `.py` extension to identify your files
* Keep your code organized by splitting it into separate files (e.g. `hello_world.py`, `main.py`)
* Use descriptive variable names and comments to make your code easy to understand

### Example Use Cases

* Use this basic structure as a starting point for more complex programs
* Experiment with different data types and operations (e.g. arithmetic, string manipulation)
* Learn about Python's standard library and built-in functions

## Troubleshooting Tips

* Check the console output for errors or unexpected behavior
* Verify that your program is running correctly by checking its output in a debugger
* Use print statements to debug your code and understand what's happening at runtime
