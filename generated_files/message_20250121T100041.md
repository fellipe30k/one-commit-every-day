Here's an example of a simple README.md that explains how to write a simple read CSV in Python:

# Writing a Simple Read CSV in Python
=====================================

## Introduction
------------

This guide will walk you through the process of reading a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file into a Python list using the built-in `csv` module.

## Step 1: Install Required Libraries
------------------------------------

To read a CSV file, you'll need to install the `pandas` library. Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install pandas
```
## Step 2: Read the CSV File
---------------------------

Create a new Python script and add the following code:
```python
import csv

def read_csv(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            reader = csv.reader(file)
            data = list(reader)
        return data
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Sorry, the file {filename} was not found.")
        return None
```
This function takes a filename as an argument and attempts to read the CSV file. If the file is not found, it catches the `FileNotFoundError` exception and prints an error message.

## Step 3: Example Use Case
----------------------

Create a new file called `example.csv` with the following contents:
```csv
Name,Age,Country
John,30,USA
Jane,25,UK
```
Run the following code to read the CSV file:
```python
filename = 'example.csv'
data = read_csv(filename)

if data is not None:
    print(data)
```
This should output:
```
['Name', 'Age', 'Country']
['John', '30', 'USA']
['Jane', '25', 'UK']
```
## Tips and Variations
-----------------------

* To write a simple write operation, you can use the `csv.writer` class to write data back into the CSV file.
* If your CSV file has multiple columns, you may need to specify the column names explicitly when reading or writing the file.
* You can also use other modules such as `pandas` and `numpy` for more complex data manipulation tasks.
