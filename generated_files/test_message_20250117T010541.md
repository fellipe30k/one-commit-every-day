# Getting Started with Hello World in Python
=============================================

## Introduction

Welcome to our guide on writing a simple "Hello, World!" application in Python. This tutorial will walk you through the process of creating and running a basic script that displays a greeting message.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed on your system (preferably the latest version)
* A text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to write and run the code

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Create a new file**: Create a new file in your preferred location, e.g., `hello_world.py`. This will be where you'll store your Python script.
2. **Copy and paste the code**: Copy the following code into your `hello_world.py` file:
```
print("Hello, World!")
```
This is a basic "Hello, World!" program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console when run.

## Step 2: Save and Run the Code

* Save the file by pressing Ctrl+S (or Cmd+S on a Mac) or by clicking the "File" menu and selecting "Save".
* Open a terminal or command prompt in your working directory. If you're using Windows, right-click on an empty area and select "Open Command Prompt Here". On macOS, use Spotlight to search for Terminal.
* Navigate to the directory where your `hello_world.py` file is located using the `cd` command (e.g., `cd ~/Desktop/your_project`). Then, run the script by typing:
```
python hello_world.py
```
## Step 3: Verify the Output

After running the script, you should see a message printed to the console indicating that "Hello, World!" was displayed. You can verify this by opening a new terminal or command prompt and typing `echo Hello, World!` (on Windows) or `echo Hello, World!` (on macOS).

## Example Use Cases

* Run the script from your project directory: `python hello_world.py`
* Modify the code to add more features, such as prompting for user input or displaying different messages
* Experiment with different Python versions and operating systems to see how they affect the output

That's it! You've successfully written and run a simple "Hello, World!" application in Python.
