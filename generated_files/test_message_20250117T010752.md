Here's an example of what your `README.md` file might look like:

# Hello World in Python

Welcome to this guide on writing a simple "Hello, World!" application in Python.

## Prerequisites

* Basic understanding of Python and its syntax
* A text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) of your choice

## Creating the Project

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it: `mkdir hello-world && cd hello-world`
3. Initialize a new Python project using `python -m venv venv` (optional, but recommended)
4. Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (on Linux/Mac) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (on Windows)

## Writing the Code

1. Create a new file called `hello.py`: `touch hello.py`
2. Copy and paste the following code into your `hello.py` file:
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
3. Save the file and navigate back to your project directory: `cd ..`

## Running the Application

1. Activate the virtual environment (if you activated it earlier): `source venv/bin/activate`
2. Install the `pylint` tool to enforce coding standards (optional, but recommended)
3. Run the application using `python hello.py`: `python hello.py`

That's it! You should now see "Hello, World!" printed to your console.

## Troubleshooting

* If you encounter any errors, check the error messages and ensure that your code is correct.
* For more advanced topics, refer to the official Python documentation: <https://docs.python.org/3/>
