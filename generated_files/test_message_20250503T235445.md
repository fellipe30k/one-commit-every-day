# Writing Simple CSV Files with Python

## Introduction

This guide demonstrates how to write basic CSV files using Python. A CSV (Comma Separated Values) file is a plain text file that stores tabular data, including columns of values separated by commas.

## Step 1: Install Required Libraries

To write CSV files in Python, you'll need to install the `pandas` library, which provides an efficient and powerful way to work with tabular data. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Step 2: Create a New CSV File

Create a new file named `example.csv` in your preferred location.

## Step 3: Write Data to the CSV File

Use the following code to write simple data to the CSV file:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Define some sample data
data = {
    'Name': ['John', 'Alice', 'Bob'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35],
    'Country': ['USA', 'UK', 'Canada']
}

# Create a DataFrame from the data dictionary
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Write the DataFrame to the CSV file
df.to_csv('example.csv', index=False)
```

## Step 4: Read Data from the CSV File

To read data from the CSV file, use the following code:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Define a function to read and print the CSV file
def read_csv(filename):
    try:
        # Create a DataFrame from the CSV file
        df = pd.read_csv(filename)
        
        # Print the first few rows of the DataFrame
        print(df.head())
        
        return df
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"File '{filename}' not found.")
        return None

# Read and print data from the 'example.csv' file
read_csv('example.csv')
```

## Step 5: Write Data to a File (Optional)

If you want to write data to a new CSV file instead of reading from an existing one, use the following code:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Define some sample data
data = {
    'Name': ['John', 'Alice', 'Bob'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35],
    'Country': ['USA', 'UK', 'Canada']
}

# Create a DataFrame from the data dictionary
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Write the DataFrame to the 'example2.csv' file
df.to_csv('example2.csv', index=False)
```

## Example Use Cases

*   Data analysis: Read and write CSV files using Python libraries like `pandas`.
*   Automation: Automate tasks by writing scripts that read and write data to CSV files.
*   Data import/export: Import and export data from/to various formats, including CSV.
