Here's a sample README.md file that provides instructions on how to write a simple read CSV in Python:

# Simple Read CSV in Python
======================================================

## Overview

This is a basic guide on how to read a simple CSV (Comma Separated Values) file in Python. CSV files are widely used for data storage and exchange between applications.

## Installation

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas
```
## Example Code

Here's an example of how you can read a CSV file in Python using the `pandas` library:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample CSV file
data = {'Name': ['John', 'Alice', 'Bob'], 
        'Age': [25, 30, 35]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Read the CSV file into a DataFrame
df_read = pd.read_csv('example.csv')

# Print the first few rows of the DataFrame
print(df_read.head())
```
## Explanation

1. Import the `pandas` library.
2. Create a sample CSV file with two columns: `Name` and `Age`.
3. Use the `pd.DataFrame()` constructor to create a DataFrame from the CSV data.
4. Use the `read_csv()` function to read the CSV file into a DataFrame.
5. Print the first few rows of the DataFrame using the `head()` method.

## Tips

* Make sure to replace `'example.csv'` with the actual path to your CSV file.
* You can customize the header row by passing a `header=None` argument when creating the DataFrame.
* You can also use the `to_csv()` function to write data back into a CSV file.
