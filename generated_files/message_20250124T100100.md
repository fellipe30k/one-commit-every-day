# Write a Simple Read CSV in Python

This is a step-by-step guide on how to create a simple text-based CSV reader in Python.

## Table of Contents

*   [Getting Started](#getting-started)
*   [Reading the CSV File](#reading-the-csv-file)
*   [Writing Your Own CSV Reader](#writing-your-own-csv-reader)

## Getting Started

First, you need to install the `csv` module in your Python environment. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install python-csv
```

## Reading the CSV File

Here's a simple example of how you can read an existing CSV file using `csv`. Let's assume that we have a sample CSV file called `data.csv` in the same directory as our Python script.

```python
import csv

def read_csv(file_path):
    """
    Reads a CSV file into a list of lists.

    Args:
        file_path (str): The path to the CSV file.

    Returns:
        list: A 2D list representing the contents of the CSV file.
    """
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            reader = csv.reader(file)
            data = []
            for row in reader:
                data.append(row)
            return data
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"The file {file_path} was not found.")
        return []

# Usage example
csv_data = read_csv('data.csv')
for row in csv_data:
    print(row)
```

## Writing Your Own CSV Reader

To write your own simple CSV reader, you can create a class that inherits from `csv.DictReader`. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```python
import csv

class SimpleCSVReader(csv.DictReader):
    def __init__(self, file_path):
        super().__init__(file_path)

    def read(self):
        """
        Reads the CSV file into a list of dictionaries.

        Returns:
            dict: A dictionary representing each row in the CSV file.
        """
        data = []
        for row in self:
            # You can modify this to include any additional fields you need
            data.append({
                'column1': row['column1'],
                'column2': row['column2']
            })
        return data

# Usage example
csv_reader = SimpleCSVReader('data.csv')
for row in csv_reader.read():
    print(row)
```

This is a very basic example of how you can write a simple CSV reader. Depending on your requirements, you may want to add more features such as handling missing values, sorting the data, etc.
