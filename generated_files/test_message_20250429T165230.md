Here's a basic example of a README.md file that provides instructions on how to create a simple read CSV in Python:

```
# Import the required libraries
import csv

# Define a function to read a CSV file
def read_csv(filename):
    """
    Reads a CSV file into a list of lists.

    Args:
        filename (str): The name of the CSV file to read.

    Returns:
        list: A 2D list where each sublist represents a row in the CSV file.
    """

    try:
        # Attempt to open and read the CSV file
        with open(filename, 'r') as csvfile:
            reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
            data = []
            for row in reader:
                data.append(row)

        return data

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The file '{filename}' was not found.")
        return None

# Example usage
csv_filename = 'example.csv'
data = read_csv(csv_filename)
if data is not None:
    # Print the contents of the CSV file
    for row in data:
        print(row)

```

This README.md file includes:

- A brief introduction to what a csv (comma-separated values) file is.
- An example function `read_csv` that demonstrates how to read a CSV file into a list of lists using Python's built-in csv module.
- Some basic error handling for the case where the specified file does not exist.

Note: The above code assumes that you have Python and the csv module installed. If you're using a different IDE or operating system, you may need to install additional libraries or configure your environment in some way.
