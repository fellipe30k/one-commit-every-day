Here's an example of a simple README.md file explaining how to write a simple read CSV in Python:

# Read CSV File in Python
========================

## Introduction

This guide demonstrates how to read a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file in Python. A CSV file is a simple text file where each row represents a data point and each column contains specific information.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* `pandas` library (comes pre-installed with Python)

## Installation

No installation required, pandas comes bundled with Python.

## Reading a CSV File

### Using `pandas.read_csv()`

You can use the following code to read a CSV file:

```python
import pandas as pd

def read_csv_file(file_path):
    try:
        # Read the CSV file using pandas
        df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
        
        # Print the first few rows of the DataFrame
        print(df.head())
        
        return df
    
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Error: The specified file does not exist.")
    
    except pd.errors.EmptyDataError:
        print("Error: The specified file is empty.")
    
    except pd.errors.ParserError as e:
        print(f"Error parsing the file: {e}")
```

## Example Use Case

Suppose we have a CSV file called `data.csv` with the following content:

```csv
Name,Age,Country
John,25,USA
Alice,30,UK
Bob,35,Canada
```

We can use the above code to read this file and print out the first few rows:

```python
df = read_csv_file('data.csv')
print(df.head())
```

## Tips

* Make sure to replace `'data.csv'` with your actual file path.
* If you encounter any errors, check the error message for more information.
* You can also use `pd.read_csv()` without specifying the file path by passing the file name directly to it. For example: `df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')`.
