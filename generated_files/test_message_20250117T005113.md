# Hello World in Python
==========================

A simple guide on how to write and run a "Hello World" program in Python.

## Setting up the Environment
------------------------------

To start, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website: <https://www.python.org/downloads/>

Once installed, create a new directory for your project and navigate into it in your terminal or command prompt.

## Writing the Code
-----------------

Create a file called `hello_world.py` in your project directory and add the following code:

```python
# hello_world.py

print("Hello, World!")
```

This is the basic structure of a Python "Hello World" program. The `print()` function is used to output text to the console.

## Running the Code
------------------

To run your code, save it in the `hello_world.py` file and navigate back into your project directory in your terminal or command prompt.

You should see the following output:

```
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations! You have just written and run a simple "Hello World" program in Python.
