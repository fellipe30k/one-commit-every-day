Here's a sample README.md for your Python Hello World example:

# Simple Python Hello World
=====================================

A basic "Hello, World!" example demonstrating how to write code in Python.

## Getting Started
---------------

To run this script, save it as `hello_world.py` and execute it using Python:
```bash
$ python hello_world.py
```
This will output the classic "Hello, World!" message to the console.

## Code Explanation
-----------------

The script consists of a single function `hello_world` that simply prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Here's a breakdown of the code:

* The first line `# Simple Python Hello World` is a comment that provides metadata about the file.
* The next lines `print("Hello, World!")` define a print statement that outputs the string "Hello, World!". This is the "Hello, World!" message that will be displayed when you run the script.

## Usage
-----

This code can be used as a starting point for any Python project. You can modify it to suit your needs by adding additional functionality or modifying the output to display different messages.
