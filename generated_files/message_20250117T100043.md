# Write a Simple Read from a CSV File in Python

This guide shows you how to create and read a simple CSV (Comma Separated Values) file in Python.

## Prerequisites

*   You have Python installed on your computer
*   Familiarity with basic programming concepts and data structures is required

## Installing Required Libraries

You will need the `csv` library to write and read the CSV file. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install python-csv
```

Alternatively, you can use a package manager like conda or brew if you're using a Linux-based system.

## Writing the CSV File

To create a simple CSV file, you'll need to specify the header row and values for each column. Here's an example:

```python
import csv

# Define the data
data = [
    ["Name", "Age", "City"],
    ["John Doe", 30, "New York"],
    ["Jane Doe", 25, "Chicago"]
]

# Open the file in write mode (append by default)
with open("example.csv", "w", newline="") as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)

    # Write the header row
    writer.writerow(data[0])

    # Write each row of data
    for row in data[1:]:
        writer.writerow(row)
```

## Reading the CSV File

To read a simple CSV file, you'll need to specify the filename and the delimiter (in this case, a comma). Here's an example:

```python
import csv

# Define the filename
filename = "example.csv"

# Open the file in read mode
with open(filename, "r", newline="") as csvfile:
    reader = csv.reader(csvfile)

    # Read each row of data and print it
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
```

## Tips and Variations

*   You can specify a specific delimiter (e.g., tabs or spaces) by using the `delimiter` parameter when opening the file.
*   To read multiple CSV files, you'll need to modify the filename accordingly.
*   If your data is very large, consider using a more efficient storage solution like a database.

## Example Use Cases

This simple guide can be used as a starting point for a variety of applications where working with CSV files is necessary. Here are some example use cases:

*   Data analysis and visualization
*   Automated reporting
*   Web scraping (if you need to scrape data from websites)
*   Building custom tools or scripts that manipulate CSV files
