# Hello World in Python
=====================================

This is a basic example of writing a "Hello World" program in Python.

## Prerequisites

## Step-by-Step Instructions
---------------------------

1.  Create a new file and save it with a `.py` extension (e.g., `hello_world.py`).
2.  Copy and paste the following code into your new file:
    ```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
3.  Save the file.
4.  Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved your file.
5.  Run the program using Python by typing `python hello_world.py` in your terminal.
6.  Press Enter to execute the program.

## What's Happening?
