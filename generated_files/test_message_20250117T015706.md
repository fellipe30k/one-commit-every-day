Here's an example of a simple README.md file for a Python tutorial on writing a "Hello World" program:

# Hello World in Python
==========================

Welcome to this quick guide on how to write a simple "Hello World" program in Python.

## Prerequisites
---------------

* Basic understanding of Python syntax and data types
* A text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) of your choice

## Step 1: Create a New File
-------------------------

Open a text editor or IDE and create a new file with a `.py` extension, for example `hello_world.py`.

## Step 2: Write the Code
---------------------

The code for this simple "Hello World" program is as follows:
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
Save this code in your newly created file.

## Step 3: Run the Code
---------------------

To run the code, you can use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a text editor. Here are some common options:

* PyCharm: Select "Run" > "Edit Configurations..." and choose "Python Script" as the interpreter.
* Visual Studio Code: Use the built-in Python extension to launch the terminal.
* Command Line: Navigate to your directory, type `python hello_world.py`, and press Enter.

## Step 4: Verify the Output
-------------------------

Once you've run the code, it will print "Hello, World!" to the console. You can verify this by opening a new terminal or command prompt and typing the same command.

Congratulations! You have now written and run your first Python program.

## Troubleshooting
------------------

* Make sure you saved the file with a `.py` extension.
* If you're using an IDE, check that the Python interpreter is set to point to the correct location on your system.
