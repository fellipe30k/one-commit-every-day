Here's an example of a README.md that explains how to write a simple "Hello World" in Python:

# Hello World in Python

Welcome to this simple guide on writing a basic "Hello World" program in Python.

## Prerequisites

* Basic understanding of the Python programming language
* A text editor or IDE (such as PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, etc.)

## Step 1: Create a New File

Create a new file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `hello_world.py`) and save it in your preferred location.

## Step 2: Write the Code

Open the `hello_world.py` file and add the following code:
```python
# Print "Hello World" to the console
print("Hello, World!")
```
This code simply prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console when run.

## Step 3: Run the Code

Save the file and navigate to a terminal or command prompt. Run the script using Python (e.g., `python hello_world.py`).
```
$ python hello_world.py
Hello, World!
```
## Step 4: Experiment with Your Program

Run your program multiple times to see how it behaves. Try changing the code by adding more print statements or modifying the logic.

That's it! You now have a simple "Hello World" program written in Python.

Note: This guide assumes you're using Python 3.x. If you're using an earlier version, you may need to modify the syntax accordingly.
